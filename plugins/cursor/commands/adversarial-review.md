Run an adversarial Cursor review through the shared plugin runtime.
Position it as a challenge review that questions the chosen implementation, design choices, tradeoffs, and assumptions.
It is not just a stricter pass over implementation defects.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Cursor's output verbatim to the user.
- Keep the framing focused on whether the current approach is the right one, what assumptions it depends on, and where the design could fail under real-world conditions.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run through the companion's background mode.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work for auto or working-tree review even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant scope is actually empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the scoped review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not weaken the adversarial framing or rewrite the user's focus text.
- The companion script handles `--wait` and `--background`; its background mode detaches the review itself.
- `/cursor:adversarial-review` uses the same review target selection as `/cursor:review`.
- It supports working-tree review, branch review, and `--base <ref>`.
- It does not support `--scope staged` or `--scope unstaged`.
- Unlike `/cursor:review`, it can still take extra focus text after the flags.

Resolve `<plugin-root>` as the first directory that contains `scripts/cursor-companion.mjs`:
1. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`
2. `$PLUGIN_ROOT`
3. `~/.cursor/plugins/local/cursor`
4. `~/.config/opencode/plugins/cursor`
5. otherwise search the host plugin cache for this plugin's `scripts/cursor-companion.mjs`

If none exist, stop and print those paths. Do not invent a companion elsewhere.

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "<plugin-root>/scripts/cursor-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.

Background flow:
- If `--background` is present, run the companion normally and include all of the user's flags:
```bash
node "<plugin-root>/scripts/cursor-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- The companion detaches the review itself. Do not wait for completion in this turn.
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Cursor adversarial review started in the background. Check `/cursor:status` for progress."
